# what is going on here?

# len is counting the number of characters in the string as the variable is a string
tup = 'Hello'
print(len(tup))


# len is counting the number of items in the tuple as this variable is a tuple defined by the comma after the string therefore the console prints 1 because there is one item in the tuple
tup = 'Hello',
print(len(tup))
